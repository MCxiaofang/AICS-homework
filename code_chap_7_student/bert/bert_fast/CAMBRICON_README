```shell
./run_squad.sh run_mode
```

Before running, make sure you have set the following variables in run_squad.sh:
  CHECKPOINT_DIR: path to a finetuned ckpt.
  OUTPUT_DIR: path to the output directory you want

There are 2 run mode for choice:
  auto : Firstly, we will freeze the ckpt into a frozen model,
         then quantify the model as a int model which will be
         deployed on MLU later.
  evaluate : If you have generated a frozen model before, just 
             evaluate directly.

Output:
  The dev set predictions will be saved into file `predictions.json` in
  the `output_dir`:

Finally, evaluate the acuraccy of predictions:

```shell
python $SQUAD_DIR/evaluate-v1.1.py $SQUAD_DIR/dev-v1.1.json ./squad/predictions.json
```

Which should produce an output like this:

```shell
{"f1": 88.41249612335034, "exact_match": 81.2488174077578}
```
